# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.


- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

- Undirected Graphs

An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.


- Directed Graphs (Digraph)

A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
